# Freecell

##### About

Made as a final project in pairs for a grade 12 programming course.

##### Playing

1. Get [Ready to Program 1.7.1](http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/)
2. Clone the repo
3. Open FreeCellApplet.java in Ready to Program's editor
4. Select the run option (files will be compiled automatically)

The loop that runs while the mouse is moving has no delay (foolish) so the main cpu core will be in constant use. 

Quick Solve only attempts to place cards onto their relevant suit's slot on the top-right.
